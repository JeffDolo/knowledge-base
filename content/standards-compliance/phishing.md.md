# Phishing Attacks  

Phishing is one of the most common tricks used by cybercriminals. In a phishing attack, someone tries to fool you into giving up sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, or banking details. The message often looks real, like an email from your bank, a company you shop at, or even a coworker.  

## Types of Phishing  
- **Email phishing** – fake emails that look like they come from trusted sources.  
- **Spear phishing** – highly targeted messages aimed at specific people or organizations.  
- **Smishing** – phishing attempts sent through SMS text messages.  
- **Vishing** – phone calls where the attacker pretends to be someone trustworthy.  

> **Quick Tip:** Always double-check links and sender details before clicking. If something feels “off,” it probably is.

Phishing is often the doorway to bigger problems, like spreading [[malware]] or supporting [[social-engineering]] scams.
