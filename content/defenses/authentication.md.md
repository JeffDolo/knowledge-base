# Authentication  

**Authentication** is the process of verifying a user’s identity before granting access.  

## Types of Authentication  
- **Passwords** – The most common method, but vulnerable.  
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** – Combines password + phone code + biometrics.  
- **Biometric Authentication** – Uses fingerprints, face, or iris scans.  

## Example  
Online banking often requires both a password and a one-time code sent via SMS.  

## Importance  
- Ensures only authorized users can access systems.  
- Reduces risk of account takeovers.
