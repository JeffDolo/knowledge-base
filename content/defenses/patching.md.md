# Patching  

**Patching** is the process of updating software to fix vulnerabilities, improve performance, or add new features.  

## Why Patching Matters  
- Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems.  
- Zero-day vulnerabilities spread quickly.  
- Regular patching reduces attack surface.  

## Example  
The **WannaCry ransomware (2017)** spread because many systems had not applied Microsoftâ€™s patch for a Windows vulnerability.  

## Best Practices  
- Enable automatic updates where possible.  
- Regularly update operating systems and applications.  
- Test patches in controlled environments before deployment.
