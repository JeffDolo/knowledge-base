# Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)  

**IDS** (Intrusion Detection System) monitors network traffic for suspicious activity.  
**IPS** (Intrusion Prevention System) not only detects but also blocks threats.  

## IDS vs IPS  
- **IDS** – Like a security camera: alerts but doesn’t block.  
- **IPS** – Like a security guard: stops attackers in real time.  

## Example  
Snort is a popular open-source IDS tool.  

## Benefits  
- Protects against network-based attacks.  
- Complements firewalls.
