# Firewalls  

A **firewall** is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on security rules.  

## Types of Firewalls  
- **Packet-Filtering** – Checks headers of network packets.  
- **Stateful Inspection** – Tracks active connections.  
- **Proxy Firewalls** – Act as intermediaries between users and services.  
- **Next-Gen Firewalls** – Combine deep packet inspection with intrusion prevention.  

## Example  
Most home routers include built-in firewalls to block malicious traffic.  

## Benefits  
- First line of defense against external threats.  
- Can block suspicious IP addresses.  
- Helps enforce company security policies.
