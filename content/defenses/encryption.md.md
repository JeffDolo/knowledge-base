# Encryption  

**Encryption** is the process of converting information into a coded format so that only authorized users can read it.  

## Types of Encryption  
- **Symmetric (AES, DES)** – Same key for encryption and decryption.  
- **Asymmetric (RSA, ECC)** – Uses public and private key pairs.  
- **Hashing (SHA-256, MD5)** – One-way transformation of data.  

## Real Example  
Messaging apps like **WhatsApp** and **Signal** use end-to-end encryption to protect conversations.  

## Importance  
- Protects data confidentiality.  
- Ensures secure online transactions.  
- Critical for cloud storage and online banking.
