# Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)  

A **DDoS attack** floods a website or service with fake traffic, making it unavailable to real users.  

## How It Works  
1. Attackers build a **botnet** of infected devices.  
2. The botnet sends massive requests to the target.  
3. The server crashes under the load.  

## Famous Example  
The **Dyn DNS DDoS attack (2016)** took down Twitter, Netflix, and Spotify for hours.  

## Defense  
- Use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).  
- Implement firewalls with filtering.  
- Subscribe to cloud-based DDoS protection.
