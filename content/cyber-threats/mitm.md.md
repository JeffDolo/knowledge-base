# Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks  

A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack happens when a hacker secretly slips between two people or systems that are communicating. This way, the attacker can read, steal, or even change the messages being sent without anyone realizing it.  

## Common Techniques  
- **Session hijacking** – stealing someone’s active login session.  
- **Packet sniffing** – monitoring unencrypted network traffic.  
- **SSL stripping** – downgrading secure HTTPS traffic into insecure HTTP.  
- **Wi-Fi eavesdropping** – setting up fake Wi-Fi hotspots to trick users.  

> **Pro Tip:** Always use secure connections (HTTPS) and VPNs when possible. They make MITM attacks much harder to pull off.  

### Example

MITM attacks often go hand in hand with [[phishing]] emails and can open the door for larger threats like [[ddos]] campaigns.
