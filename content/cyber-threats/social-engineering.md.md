# Social Engineering  

Social engineering isn’t about hacking computers—it’s about hacking people. Attackers use manipulation and trickery to get individuals to reveal confidential information or perform risky actions without realizing it.  

## Common Tactics  
- **Pretexting** – pretending to be someone with authority.  
- **Baiting** – leaving infected USB drives or files to tempt people.  
- **Tailgating** – following someone into a secure area.  
- **Impersonation** – pretending to be IT support or a colleague.  

> **Key Point:** The human mind is often the weakest link in security. Awareness training can stop many social engineering attempts before they succeed.  

### Example

Social engineering often overlaps with [[phishing]] campaigns and can set the stage for more advanced threats like [[malware]] infections or [[mitm]] attacks.
