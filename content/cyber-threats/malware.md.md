# # Malware and Ransomware

Malware, short for malicious software, is a program that is created to damage a computer, steal data, or interrupt normal system operations. Attackers use malware to break into systems, steal personal or financial information, or to pressure people and organizations into paying money.  

One of the most dangerous types of malware is ransomware. Ransomware locks or encrypts files on a computer and then demands payment in exchange for unlocking them. These attacks have disrupted hospitals, schools, and even government services.
