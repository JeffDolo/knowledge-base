# Malware & Ransomware  

Malware, short for *malicious software*, is any program created to harm a computer, steal data, or disrupt systems. One of the most damaging forms of malware is ransomware, which locks your files and demands payment to get them back.  

## Common Forms of Malware  
1. **Viruses** – attach themselves to files and spread when shared.  
2. **Worms** – spread on their own through networks.  
3. **Trojans** – appear harmless but contain malicious code.  
4. **Spyware** – secretly tracks user activity.  
5. **Ransomware** – locks files until money is paid.  

> **Did you know?** Ransomware attacks have grown so much that even hospitals and schools have been forced offline until they pay.

Most malware spreads through [[phishing]] emails or fake downloads. Once it takes hold, it can even be used to launch attacks like [[ddos]] against larger targets.
