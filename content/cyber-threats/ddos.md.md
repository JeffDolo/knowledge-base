# Denial of Service (DoS & DDoS)  

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack happens when attackers flood a system or website with so much traffic that it slows down or crashes. When this attack is carried out by thousands of infected computers working together, it’s called a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).  

## Signs of a DDoS Attack  
- Websites suddenly load very slowly.  
- Services become completely unavailable.  
- A sudden spike in strange network traffic.  

> **Remember:** DDoS attacks are often powered by “botnets,” which are networks of devices secretly infected with [[malware]].  

### Example

Defenses against DDoS sometimes overlap with monitoring techniques that also help catch [[mitm]] attempts.
