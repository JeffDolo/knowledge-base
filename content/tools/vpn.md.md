# VPN (Virtual Private Network)  

A **VPN** creates a secure, encrypted connection between your device and the internet.  

## Why VPNs Are Used  
- Protect privacy by hiding IP address.  
- Encrypt data while using public Wi-Fi.  
- Allow remote workers to securely access company networks.  

## Example  
When using free coffee shop Wi-Fi, a VPN keeps hackers from stealing your login details.
