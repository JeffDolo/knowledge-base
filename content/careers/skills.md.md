# Skills Needed in Cybersecurity  

Working in cybersecurity requires both **technical skills** and **soft skills**.  

## Technical Skills  
- Networking knowledge (TCP/IP, firewalls, protocols).  
- Programming basics (Python, Bash).  
- Security tools (Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit).  
- Understanding of operating systems (Linux, Windows).  

## Soft Skills  
- Problem solving.  
- Communication (explaining risks clearly).  
- Analytical thinking.  
- Adaptability (cyber threats change constantly).  

## Example  
A penetration tester needs technical skills to find vulnerabilities and soft skills to explain them to non-technical managers.
